# Testing

This document describes the procedures and tools we use for testing Qman.

## Terminal emulators

Test against the following terminal emulators:

- console
- xterm
- urxvt
- gnome-terminal
- konsole
- terminator
- guake
- tilix
- tilda
- edex-ui
- cool-retro-term
- alacritty
- kitty
- st
- ghostty

## Configuration files

Test using the following configurations:

- [modernity.conf](https://github.com/plp13/qman/blob/main/config/modernity.conf)
- empty configuration file
- custom configuration file, depending on the test case

## Debugging

Use `gdb`.

To make sure the program gets fully rebuilt between debug sessions, we can use:

```
meson compile --clean && meson compile
```

## Memory leaks

Test for memory leaks using:

```
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --show-reachable=no --track-origins=yes --log-file=valgrind.out ./qman <arguments>
```

Then, examine `valgrind.out`.

Reports of lost memory that has been allocated by `initscr()` and
`doupdate_sp()` can safely be ignored. They are caused by `ncurses`, which has
a [tendency](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#config_leaks)
not to fully deallocate its own memory.

For more granularity, we may want to pass `--show-reachable=yes` to `valgrind`.
This, however, will result in even more spurious errors caused by `ncurses`.

## Profiling

Use the following command:

```
valgrind --tool=callgrind --dump-instr=yes --simulate-cache=yes --collect-jumps=yes ./qman <arguments>
```

This will produce a file named `callgrind.out.<pid>` where `<pid>` is the
process ID assigned to `valgrind` by the OS. Use `kcachegrind` to open this file
for further examination.
